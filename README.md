## üëã About Me

I'm an aspiring **Software Engineer** and a passionate **Computer Science student at Manipal University Jaipur**, expecting to graduate in May 2026. I'm driven by the challenge of building scalable, intelligent, and impactful software solutions. My journey into programming began early ‚Äì I've been working with **Java since the 8th grade**, which gave me a deep-rooted understanding of object-oriented principles and problem-solving.

Today, my focus is on leveraging modern technologies, particularly **Python, AI/Machine Learning (with a strong interest in NLP and Information Retrieval using tools like LangChain & LlamaIndex), and robust backend systems (FastAPI, Pydantic)**. I thrive in Unix/Linux environments and am always eager to dive into complex engineering problems, especially those involving distributed systems and large-scale data.

Beyond coding, I've also honed leadership and organizational skills as the General Secretary for IEEE GRSS Manipal University Jaipur, where I've spearheaded technical events and contributed to community engagement.
